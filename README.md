## About the Founder 

**Renee Gittins** is a game developer, engineer, and studio leader with a deep passion for fostering sustainable, inclusive, and successful game development practices. As the founder of **Game Dev Foundry**, she's created the initial set of resources to help aspiring and established developers navigate the complex challenges of building and running a game studio.  

With over a decade of experience in game development, studio leadership, and industry advocacy- including her time as the Executive Director of the International Game Developers Association- Renee has seen firsthand the hurdles that developers face, from securing funding and managing teams to launching and sustaining a game in the market. She believes that knowledge should be shared, not gatekept, and that studios thrive when they learn from one another.  

**Game Dev Foundry is a community-driven initiative**, and while Renee laid the foundation, she hopes many more voices will contribute their insights and experiences. The industry is always evolving, and by working together, developers can build a stronger, more informed, and more resilient game development ecosystem.
