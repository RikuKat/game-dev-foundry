# How to Pitch a Game

## Overview
A pitch deck is not just a structured presentation of your game; it is the start of a partnership. Your goal is to convince potential investors, publishers, or partners that your proposal is worth their time and money. This proposal is not just your game, but includes your team, budget, timeline, and market viability.

## Key Principles of a Strong Pitch
- Highlight what makes your game unique and compelling.
- Showcase your team's strengths and past successes.
- Clearly define your market potential and audience.
- Demonstrate why your game fits well within the industry landscape.
- Address concerns about your team's ability to ship the game.
- Provide a realistic timeline and budget.
- Show how your team will handle potential challenges.
- Avoid vague descriptions; instead, provide concrete plans and data.

## Final Tips 

### 1. Avoid Common Pitfalls
- **Lack of Vision:** Be specific about your game's features, monetization, and development plan.
- **No Clear Reasoning:** Always connect information to why it matters.
- **Unrealistic Budgets:** Asking for too little or too much makes your project seem unsustainable.
- **No Confidence/Competency:** A big part of your pitch is proving your team can make the product successfully with the resources requested.

### 2. Tailor the Pitch for Your Audience
- **Publishers vs. Investors:** Publishers want to see audience potential and execution plans, while investors focus on financial viability and long-term returns.
- **Adapt Based on Interests:** Some publishers prefer **innovative mechanics**, while others prioritize **market trends**.

### 3. Make it Visually Engaging
- **Minimal Text, More Visuals:** Keep slides concise and rely on images, charts, and gameplay footage.
- **Consistent Design:** Use a clean, readable layout that aligns with your game's aesthetic.

### 4. Be Prepared for Questions
- **Know Your Numbers:** Be ready to explain your budget breakdown and development timeline.
- **Address Concerns Proactively:** If there's a potential risk, show how you've planned to mitigate it.

### 5. Follow Up After the Pitch
- **Send Additional Materials** (Gameplay videos, design documents, business plans).
- **Stay in Touch** (Maintain communication even if they don't sign immediately).
