# Cultivating a Healthy Game Studio

## Culture for Health

A positive company culture is an integral part of a healthy studio. Culture affects every aspect of how a studio runs, from the content it creates to the retention of its staff. Employees of a company with a good culture will feel inspired and supported, and they will grow into better versions of themselves and carry their projects along with them.

### What is a Positive Work Culture?
A positive and healthy studio culture uplifts team members, enabling them to:
- Feel **supported and valued**.
- Focus on **project success**.
- **Develop professionally** and grow within the company.
- Enjoy coming to work, rather than dreading their day-to-day responsibilities.


### Benefits of a Positive Work Culture
- **Higher retention and morale** – Reducing the cost of onboarding and offboarding employees.
- **Faster development of talent** – Junior employees develop into mid-level, senior, and lead roles, uplifting others as they grow.
- **More effective employees** – Employees become increasingly valuable as they integrate into the team.
- **Better communication** – Game development is iterative, requiring open and honest communication to improve collaboration.
- **Insights into potential issues** – A transparent culture allows issues to be identified and addressed early.
- **Broader audience capabilities** – A diverse and inclusive team can appeal to a wider audience and create more accessible games.


## General Approach

To foster a thriving studio culture, focus on:
1. **Defining and upholding** a positive culture.
2. **Building and supporting** your team intentionally.
3. **Developing your team and integrating their feedback** to improve studio operations over time.
 

## Define Your Culture

### Be Explicit
Culture must be **deliberately defined and actively upheld**. A strong culture is not just a set of words on a website—it should be part of every decision made in the studio. Leadership should define, refer to, and uphold:
- **Mission** – Why does the studio exist?
- **Values** – What principles guide the studio?
- **Goals** – What are the studio's short- and long-term objectives?
- **Expectations and policies** – What behavior and performance standards are required of employees?


To be effective, these principles must be:
- **Clear and concise** – Easy to understand and remember.
- **Consistently applied** – Embedded in hiring, performance reviews, and decision-making.
- **Integrated into studio rituals** – Discussed in meetings, referenced in feedback, and reflected in daily work.

### Mission
The mission serves as the **North Star** for a studio, defining its core purpose and guiding decision-making. A strong mission statement:
- Clearly defines the **intended impact** of the studio.
- Provides **internal guidance** for employees.
- Establishes a **studio identity** that is communicated to customers and potential hires.
- Be **concise and impactful**, ideally a single sentence.

For example:
- A studio might focus on creating cooperative multiplayer experiences that inspire teamwork in new ways.
- Another might emphasize empathetic storytelling to share underrepresented narratives in games.

When making business or design decisions, leadership should be able to point to the mission statement and ask, **“Are we staying true to this goal?”**

### Core Values
Core values define **how you work** (e.g. **how the studio operates and interacts**). They serve as guiding beliefs, philosophies, and principles, shaping the studio’s culture and decision-making.

Effective values should:
- Be **clearly defined and easy to remember**.
- Have a **single, shared interpretation**—avoid vague phrases like “aim for greatness.”
- Provide **practical guidance** on how employees work and interact.
- Create **one shared understanding** across all employees.

A studio's values should be **reinforced through leadership actions and workplace policies**. Values that are ignored in practice will be dismissed by employees as meaningless.

For example, one studio's core values include:
- **Teams are stronger than heroes**.
- **Player experience first**.
- **Strong ideas loosely held**.
- **Closing is an everyday practice**.

These values are **concise, actionable, and meaningful** within that studio's' culture.

#### Healthy Culture Themes
When defining core values, consider emphasizing:
- **Employee wellness** – Supporting mental, physical, and emotional well-being.
- **Personal development and growth** – Encouraging continuous learning and skill development.
- **Honesty and openness** – Fostering a transparent and communicative workplace.
- **Praise and acknowledgment** – Ensuring that contributions are recognized and appreciated.
- **Constructive approaches** – Encouraging feedback and problem-solving over blame.
- **Protection and support of employees** – Creating policies that safeguard employees from harassment, social media attacks, and workplace hostility.



## Build Your Team

Intentional hiring is **foundational** to creating a sustainable, successful studio. A well-structured and inclusive hiring process leads to stronger teams, better games, and a healthier work environment.

### When to Hire 
Hiring someone without a clear purpose can be demoralizing for both the new hire and the existing team. Employees need structured work, defined expectations, and clear pathways for growth to feel valued and effective.

Before bringing on a new team member, consider:
- **Defined Role:** Do you have a clear understanding of what this person will contribute?
- **Onboarding Plan:** Do you have a structured way to integrate them into the team?
- **Vision Alignment:** Does this role fit into the studio’s mission and long-term strategy?
- **Growth Pathway:** How will you support their career growth and development?

#### Questions to Ask
- Do you have a 3-month view of how they will start contributing?
- Is this the right stage of development for their role?
- Do you have a vision holder or vision for their work?
- Can their work be integrated into the project?
- How will their career growth and development be supported?

### Diversity and Inclusion
Diversity is a **key factor in innovation and problem-solving**. A diverse team brings a variety of perspectives that improve decision-making, enhance creativity, and ultimately create games that resonate with broader audiences.

#### Dimensions of Diversity
Diversity encompasses multiple dimensions, including:
- Culture, race, ethnicity
- Age, gender identity, sexual orientation
- Ability/disability, neurodiversity
- Socioeconomic background, education
- Career paths, roles, location

#### The Measurable Impact of Diversity
A **Deloitte study** found that when employees feel supported in a diverse and inclusive workplace, their ability to **innovate increases by 83%**. Employees who feel valued and included are more willing to take creative risks and introduce unique ideas.

Diversity is not about assimilation into a single culture but about creating a **mosaic**—where different backgrounds and experiences come together to form something greater than the sum of its parts.

### Recruitment – Sending the Right Signals

The recruitment process should **attract a diverse range of candidates** and avoid unintentional exclusion. This requires attention to:

#### Job Descriptions
- Use clear, accessible language and **avoid jargon** that may alienate candidates.
- Refrain from unnecessary experience requirements—ensure stated expectations reflect true needs.
- Avoid language like "rockstar" or "ninja," which can be exclusionary and suggest unrealistic expectations.

#### Company Website & Online Presence
- Showcase **values, mission, and diversity efforts** prominently.
- Ensure public company images reflect inclusivity and do not unintentionally signal homogeneity.
- Maintain a professional **LinkedIn presence**, as candidates often research company leadership before applying.

#### Interview Process
- Ensure diverse representation on **interview panels** to mitigate bias and create a welcoming experience.
- **Structure interviews** to focus on evaluating soft skills, communication, and problem-solving rather than only technical ability.
- Implement an optional **casual “culture fit” interview** to let candidates express passions and goals in a relaxed environment.
- Make sure interview materials are **accessible**, such as providing images with alternative or descriptive text.

#### The Impact of Overstating Expectations
Women and other underrepresented groups in the gaming industry are **less likely to apply** if they do not meet 100% of listed qualifications. If a requirement is **flexible**, make it clear. Avoid inflated expectations that may dissuade highly capable candidates from applying.

### Qualities to Assess in Hiring
Beyond technical skills, hiring should focus on **attitude and adaptability**. An **eager learner** with a strong work ethic and adaptability is often a better long-term hire than a highly skilled candidate who resists collaboration or feedback. 

Generally, the most successful team members possess:

1. **Self-Motivation & Problem-Solving**
- Does the candidate take initiative and troubleshoot challenges independently?
- Are they comfortable asking for help when needed, without becoming stuck?

2. **Strong Communication & Collaboration Skills**
- Can they express constructive criticism effectively and accept feedback with grace?
- Are they capable of working iteratively and improving through collaboration?

3. **Growth-Oriented Mindset**
- Do they actively seek skill development and new learning opportunities?
- Are they adaptable to evolving tools, workflows, and processes?

4. **Cultural Compatibility**
- Does the candidate align with the studio’s **values and communication style**?
- Are they willing to contribute positively to the team’s work environment?


### Summary
- **Plan your hiring process carefully** to ensure clear roles, structured onboarding, and career pathways.
- **Prioritize diversity and inclusion** to improve problem-solving and innovation.
- **Optimize recruitment signals** by ensuring job descriptions, company branding, and interviews encourage a broad range of applicants.
- **Assess beyond technical skills**, focusing on communication, adaptability, and motivation.

## Support Your Team

### Humans Are Not Machines

A productive and sustainable workplace begins with recognizing that employees are **not machines**. The expectation that individuals can work continuously without breaks leads to burnout, reduced creativity, and decreased overall performance. Leaders must balance productivity with well-being to ensure long-term success.

#### The Importance of Rest and Recovery

- **Burnout Prevention**: Overworking employees results in exhaustion, decreased engagement, and increased turnover.
- **Creativity & Problem-Solving**: Proper rest allows the mind to process information, leading to innovation and better decision-making.

#### Ensuring Equal Access

- Provide **clear growth paths** that do not favor a specific demographic.
- Make **promotions and leadership opportunities** accessible to all employees, not just those who advocate for themselves most loudly.

## Effective Leadership

### Own Your Responsibilities

> "Leaders must own everything in their world. There is no one else to blame."

Effective leadership is built upon **ownership and accountability**. Leaders must take full responsibility for their team's successes and failures, creating an environment where individuals feel safe to innovate, take risks, and grow.

#### Key Aspects of Ownership:
- **Decision-Making**: Own the outcomes of choices made, whether positive or negative.
- **Team Performance**: Accept responsibility for the effectiveness, morale, and productivity of your team.
- **Problem Resolution**: Focus on solutions rather than assigning blame.
- **Continuous Learning**: Adapt and evolve based on experiences and past mistakes.

By embracing ownership, leaders foster a culture of accountability, trust, and proactive problem-solving.

### Acknowledge Failure, Pursue Solutions

Failures are inevitable in any organization, but effective leaders recognize them as learning opportunities rather than setbacks. The ability to assess failures and implement corrective actions is a defining trait of strong leadership.

#### Potential Points of Failure:
- **Misunderstood Expectations**: Lack of clarity in goals and objectives.
- **Lack of Training or Guidance**: Employees not equipped with the necessary skills or knowledge.
- **Internal Communication Issues**: Misalignment between teams, departments, or leadership.

#### Pursuit of Solutions:
1. **Identify the Root Cause**
   - Conduct post-mortems to analyze what went wrong.
   - Gather feedback from those involved.
2. **Solve Immediate Issues**
   - Address urgent consequences of the failure.
   - Implement quick fixes where necessary.
3. **Plan for Long-Term Prevention**
   - Introduce processes to mitigate future risks.
   - Adjust training and onboarding to close knowledge gaps.
4. **Foster an "Us vs. The Problem" Mindset**
   - Encourage collaboration rather than blame.
   - Shift focus towards overcoming obstacles as a team.

By proactively addressing failures and refining strategies, leaders create a resilient and adaptable team.

## Cultivate Trust and Collaboration

Trust is the foundation of a high-performing team. When employees feel supported and valued, they are more likely to contribute their best work and collaborate effectively.

#### Strategies to Cultivate Trust:
- **Recognize and Celebrate Efforts and Successes**
  - Regularly acknowledge both major achievements and small wins.
  - Provide positive reinforcement and constructive feedback.
- **Address Concerns and Feedback Professionally**
  - Create open channels for honest communication.
  - Demonstrate that leadership listens and takes action.
- **Ensure Psychological Safety**
  - Allow employees to express ideas and concerns without fear of retaliation.
  - Normalize learning from mistakes rather than punishing failures.

Trust is a two-way street—leaders must consistently demonstrate integrity, fairness, and commitment to their team’s well-being.

## Effective Communication

Communication is the backbone of leadership. Clear and structured communication ensures alignment, reduces misunderstandings, and drives productivity.

### Setting Clear Goals
Before engaging in discussions, meetings, or one-on-one sessions, leaders should define the **goal of the conversation**. Clarity in intent leads to more effective and actionable discussions.

### The STATE Framework for Constructive Conversations
To navigate challenging discussions, leaders can use the **STATE Framework**:

1. **Share Your Facts**
   - Present objective data and observations.
   - Avoid emotionally charged or biased language.
2. **Tell Your Story**
   - Explain your perspective and reasoning.
   - Use "I" statements to avoid accusations.
3. **Ask for Perspectives**
   - Invite others to share their viewpoints.
   - Encourage diverse opinions and feedback.
4. **Tentatively Talk**
   - Express ideas in a way that invites dialogue rather than defensiveness.
   - Use phrases like "I wonder if…" or "What do you think about…"
5. **Encourage Testing**
   - Foster an environment where new ideas can be safely explored.
   - Be open to changing your stance based on feedback.

### Leading with "Why"
One of the most effective ways to empower a team is to **explain the reasoning** behind decisions and expectations. When employees understand the "why," they can:
- Make informed decisions aligned with company goals.
- Offer creative solutions rather than just following orders.
- Feel a sense of ownership over their work.

### Establishing and Restoring Safety in Conversations
- If emotions run high, **pause the conversation** and reset.
- Validate concerns and seek common ground.
- Reinforce mutual respect and shared objectives.

### Restating and Clarifying Before Moving to Action
To prevent miscommunications, ensure alignment by:
- Summarizing key points at the end of discussions.
- Confirming action items and responsibilities.
- Encouraging team members to repeat back instructions or agreements to solidify understanding.

By mastering effective communication, leaders can build strong relationships, resolve conflicts efficiently, and drive team cohesion.
