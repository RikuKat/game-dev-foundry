# Inclusive Game Development

## Introduction

Games are a powerful, immersive medium, offering players the chance to step into new worlds, experience diverse perspectives, and shape their own stories. The richness of games comes not just from their mechanics and narratives, but from the diversity of voices, cultures, and experiences they represent.

Inclusive game design isn't just about representation -- it's about creating deeper, more immersive experiences that resonate with a broader audience. By embracing diversity in characters, environments, and gameplay, developers can cultivate a passionate community, differentiate their games in a crowded market, and enhance both player engagement and public perception.

This document outlines the essential steps and best practices for designing and developing games that are inclusive, impactful, and accessible to all.

## What is Diversity?

Diversity encompasses any dimension that differentiates groups and individuals. It includes, but is not limited to:

- **Culture**
- **Race**
- **Ethnicity**
- **Physical appearance**
- **Age**
- **Gender identity**
- **Sexual orientation**
- **Ability/disability**
- **Neurodiversity**
- **Socioeconomic background**
- **Behavioral/ethnodiversity**
- **Ideologies and viewpoints**
- **Education**
- **Career and roles**
- **Marital/parental status**
- **Location and geography**
- **History**
- **Technology access**

Diverse backgrounds enrich games with varied histories, characters, and contexts. Additionally, diversity extends to game genres, mechanics, and features, allowing broader audience appeal.

A diverse team also naturally builds more diverse and inclusive games, incorporating various backgrounds, experiences, abilities, heritages, and cultures into the development process.

## Research

Thorough research before full production helps developers expand their inspirations across **culture, history, current game trends, and accessibility**. A wide range of sources prevents bias and enhances creative diversity.

### Cultural Considerations

Culture influences worldbuilding, character development, and game mechanics. Developers should handle cultural influences with **reverence and expert consultation** to ensure accuracy and respect.

### Historical Context

Historical records provide inspiration but can be biased or incomplete. Developers should use multiple sources, including **anthropological records**, to create well-rounded narratives.

### Accessibility Research

Early research into **accessibility best practices and tools** is crucial. Engaging directly with players with disabilities through **user research** ensures broader accessibility.

### Contracted Experts

A single organization may not have members with expertise in accessibility nor every cultural background represented in their games. Hiring **consultants and cultural experts** ensures inclusive approaches, respectful treatment of diverse topics, and avoids potential criticism.

## World Building

A game's world defines the context for gameplay and narrative. Considering diversity in geography, culture, and history enhances immersion.

### Geography and Architecture

- Geography impacts characters' lifestyles and available resources.
- Architecture reflects cultural, environmental, and economic influences.
- Tools and artifacts reveal a society's technological advancement and daily life.

### Cultural and Historical Influences

- Cultures shape social norms, traditions, and values.
- Divergence from historical records can create richer representations and narratives.

## Characters

Characters should reflect a diverse range of backgrounds, identities, and experiences.

### Cultural Representation

- A diverse cast enhances relatability and immersion.
- Religious, spiritual, and ideological portrayals should be handled with care.

### Personality and Traits

- Characters should have **depth**, including backstories, personality traits, and flaws.
- Mental health representation should be well-researched and respectfully handled.

### Gender Expression and Appearance

- Gender expression should not be restricted by **outdated stereotypes**.
- Clothing, body type, and style should allow for **varied and authentic representation**.

## Design and Mechanics

Game mechanics impact inclusivity through **accessibility, audience engagement, and player agency**.

### Accessibility Considerations

- **Text legibility, UI clarity, and control flexibility** should be optimized.
- **Avoid reliance on color cues alone**.
- **Difficulty settings and customizable controls** improve accessibility.

### Player Character Customization

- Players should be able to **customize their character fully**, including gender identity and pronouns.
- **Romantic options** should not be arbitrarily restricted.

## Community and Moderation

Online communities shape player experience and game reputation.

### Code of Conduct

- A **clear, concise Code of Conduct** sets behavior expectations.
- Enforceable policies ensure a **safe, respectful community**.

### Moderation Strategies

- **Personal tools** (mute/block), **AI moderation**, and **hired moderators** help maintain a positive environment.
- **Community tone-setting** prevents toxicity and harassment.

## Marketing

Marketing must align with the game's inclusivity goals to **reach the broadest possible audience**.

### Inclusive Representation

- **Diverse characters and imagery** in promotional materials broaden audience appeal.
- **Avoid biased marketing language** that alienates potential players.

### Accessibility Information

- Clearly communicate accessibility features in marketing materials and storefronts.

## Inclusive Review Process

A **diverse review panel** ensures marketing and in-game content avoid **stereotypes, bias, or exclusionary themes**.

---

By prioritizing **inclusivity, accessibility, and diverse representation**, developers can create games that resonate with a wider audience while fostering **positive engagement and cultural awareness**. Incorporating these considerations into all aspects of game development leads to a richer, more meaningful experience for all players.
